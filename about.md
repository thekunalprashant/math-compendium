The Math Compendium is a curated repository of competitive mathematics techniques, designed for students, educators, and math enthusiasts preparing for high-level contests like the AMC, AIME, and beyond.

## Mission

Our goal is to distill complex mathematical strategies into rapid, review-ready notes. We focus on:
- **Efficiency:** Techniques like value substitution that save critical contest time.
- **Clarity:** Step-by-step breakdowns of non-intuitive problem-solving patterns.
- **Rigor:** Maintaining mathematical precision while prioritizing competition-style execution.

## Participation

We welcome contributions from the community. If you have a technique or a set of notes you'd like to share, follow the academic structure of this project.

### How to Contribute
1. **Repository Hub:** [Fork the project on GitHub](https://github.com/thekunalprashant/math-compendium/fork)
2. **Standard Format:** Add your topic directory in `/topics/your-topic-name/index.md`
3. **Review Process:** Submit a Pull Request for peer review.

### Standard Topic Template
To maintain a professional aesthetic, please use the following frontmatter:

```yaml
---
layout: page
title: Your Topic Name
description: A concise summary of the method
popular: true    # Optional
permalink: /topics/your-topic-name/
---
```

## Guidelines
- **Precision:** Use LaTeX for all mathematical expressions: $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$.
- **Structure:** Always include a core principle followed by categorized examples.
- **Focus:** Keep explanations competition-focused (optimized for speed and intuition).
- **Automated Dating:** You don't need to specify a date; the system automatically uses the date your topic is published to the compendium.
