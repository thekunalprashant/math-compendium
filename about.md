Our goal is to distill complex strategies into rapid, review-ready notes. We focus on efficiency, clarity, and rigor—ensuring that every technique shared is both practical and precise.

## Mission

- **Efficiency:** Techniques that save critical time and mental effort.
- **Clarity:** Step-by-step breakdowns of non-intuitive patterns.
- **Rigor:** Maintaining precision while prioritizing practical execution.

## Participation

We welcome contributions from the community. If you have a technique or a set of notes you'd like to share, follow the academic structure of this project.

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Project:** [Fork on GitHub](https://github.com/thekunalprashant/StudyBase/fork) to start your own branch.
2. **Standard Format:** Add your topic directory in the appropriate subject folder (e.g., `/subjects/math/your-topic-name/index.md`).
3. **Submit Review:** Open a Pull Request for peer review and integration.

### Topic Template

## Guidelines

- **Precision:** Use LaTeX for all mathematical expressions: $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$.
- **Structure:** Always include a core principle followed by categorized examples.
- **Focus:** Keep explanations competition-focused (optimized for speed and intuition).
- **Automation:** You don't need to specify a date; the system automatically retrieves commit times from Git.
